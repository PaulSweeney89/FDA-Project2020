**Fundamentals of Data Analysis Project 2020**

*Development of linear regression model for the wind turbine [powerproduction dataset](https://github.com/PaulSweeney89/FDA-Project2020/blob/main/powerproduction.csv) in order to accurately predict the power output of a windturbine for a given wind speed.*

## Introduction 

This project forms part of the Fundamentals of Data Analysis module for 2020, please refer to the [project.pdf](https://github.com/PaulSweeney89/FDA-Project2020/blob/main/Project2020.pdf) document included in this repository for the full project outline & instructions.

The main objectives of the project include:

1.  Production of a Jupyter notebook that performs simple linear regression on the powerproduction dataset.

2.  In that notebook, an explanation of the regression model and an analysis of its accuracy.

3.  Creation of a clean & well organised project repository including all standard git repository items such as a README along with documentation of all research undetaken & code developed as part of this project.

## Repository Files & Folders

List of files & folders contained within the Github Repository:

- Images folder - contains image files used within the Jupyter Notebook.
- Project2020.pdf -  - full description of the Fundamentals of Data Analysis Project & objectives.
- .gitignore file -  specifies files to be untracked by git.
- README.md - This README markdown file.
- powerproduction.csv - initial project powerproduction dataset in csv file format. 
- powerproduction_clean.csv - Output from project a cleaned version of the project powerproduction dataset in csv file format.
- windpower.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook file containing all the descriptive & programming objectives of the Project.

## Jupyter Notebook

Note: all descriptive & programming objectives of the project have been fully complete within the interactive Jupyter Notebook environment, please refer to the [windpower.ipynb](https://github.com/PaulSweeney89/FDA-Project2020/blob/main/windpower.ipynb) within this repository.

The notebook is assiocated with the Ipython kernal and therfore all code has been written & runs in Python.

##  Jupyter Notebook Environment

The jupyter notebook can be viewed as a static web page by opening the [windpower.ipynb](https://github.com/PaulSweeney89/FDA-Project2020/blob/main/windpower.ipynb) file directly within this github repository. 

The fully interactive Jupyter notebook can be accessed via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com), the Python and R programming distribution which includes many data-science specific packages.

1. Download & install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
2. Create a local copy of the Github Repository on your computer, either by downloading the zip file of the repository or by using the Git Clone command, refer to [Github Cloning a Repository Instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
3. Open the Anaconda Nagivator via the Windows Start Menu & launch the Jupyter Notebook web application or alternatively by opening terminal (cmd on Windows) & typing ``jupyter notebook``.
4. Within the Jupyter Notebook web application, nagivate to the folder location of the local copy of the repository & open the Jupyter Notebook .ipynb file.

**Cloud-Based Services**

Alternatively to downloading & installing  Anaconda & the Jupyter Notebook environment, cloud based servces such as [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) can be used to easily run a fully interactive Jupyter notebook in the cloud.

Google Colab is available to anyone with a Google account, it allows for quick creation of notebooks, uploading an existing notebook, or importing a notebook from any public GitHub repository, it comes with most of the commonly used Python libraries pre-installed.
