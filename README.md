**Fundamentals of Data Analysis Project 2020**

*Development of linear regression model for the wind turbine [powerproduction dataset](https://github.com/PaulSweeney89/FDA-Project2020/blob/main/powerproduction.csv) in order to accurately predict the power output of a windturbine for a given wind speed.*

## Introduction 

This project forms part of the Fundamentals of Data Analysis module for 2020, please refer to the [project.pdf](https://github.com/PaulSweeney89/FDA-Project2020/blob/main/Project2020.pdf) document included in this repository for the full project outline & instructions.

The main objectives of the project include:

1.  Production of a Jupyter notebook that performs simple linear regression on the powerproduction dataset.

2.  In that notebook, an explanation of the regression model and an analysis of its accuracy.

3.  Creation of a clean & well organised project repository including all standard git repository items such as a README along with documentation of all research undetaken & code developed as part of this project.

## Jupyter Notebook

Note: all descriptive & programming objectives of the project have been fully complete within the interactive Jupyter Notebook environment, please refer to the Tasks windpower.ipynb within this repository.

The notebook is assiocated with the Ipython kernal and therfore all code has been written & runs in Python.
