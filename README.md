## Introduction 

This project forms part of the Fundamentals of Data Analysis module for 2020, please refer to the [project.pdf](addlink) document included in this repository for the full project outline & instructions.

The main objectives of the project include:

    1.  Production of a Jupyter notebook that performs simple linear regression on the powerproduction dataset.
    2.  In that notebook, an explanation of the regression model and an analysis of its accuracy.
    3.  Creation of a clean & well organised project repository including all standard git repository items such as a README along with documentation of all research undetaken & code developed as part of this project.
